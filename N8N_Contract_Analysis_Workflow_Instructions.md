# N8N Contract Analysis Workflow Instructions

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive instructions for building an N8N workflow that can handle contract uploads, extract clauses, identify key elements, and analyze contracts based on the user's uploaded legal playbook.

## Step-by-Step Setup
1. **Install N8N**
   - Follow the official installation guide: [N8N Installation](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/)

2. **Create a New Workflow**
   - Open N8N and create a new workflow by clicking on the `New` button.

3. **Set Up Webhook for Contract Upload**
   - Add a **Webhook** node to your workflow.
   - Set the HTTP Method to POST.
   - Configure the Webhook URL to accept contract uploads.

4. **Add a File Upload Node**
   - Use the **HTTP Request** node to handle the uploaded file.
   - Set it to receive the file data from the Webhook.

5. **Extract Clauses**
   - Add a **Function** node to process the received file.
   - Utilize a library such as `pdf-parse` or `docx` to extract text from the contract document.

6. **Clause Identification**
   - Implement a **Set** node to define the keywords and phrases based on the legal playbook.
   - Use **IF** nodes to check for the presence of these clauses in the extracted text.

7. **Integrate API for Analysis**
   - Add an **HTTP Request** node to send the extracted clauses to a legal analysis API (e.g., OpenAI, LegalRobot).
   - Configure the API endpoint and authentication as necessary.

8. **Workflow Automation**
   - Use the **Cron** node to schedule regular checks for new contracts.
   - Set up notifications using the **Email** node to alert users about analysis results.

9. **Testing the Workflow**
   - Test the entire workflow by uploading contract documents and reviewing the output.
   - Make adjustments as necessary based on the results.

## Node Configurations
- **Webhook Node**: Configure the URL and HTTP method.
- **HTTP Request Node**: Set the method to POST for file handling.
- **Function Node**: Write custom JavaScript to extract text from the files.
- **Set Node**: Define your keywords for clause identification.
- **HTTP Request Node for API**: Input the API URL and set the method to POST.

## API Integrations
- Use APIs for legal analysis tools to enhance the workflow capabilities.
- Ensure that you handle authentication and data formats as required by the API.

## Workflow Automation Details
- Schedule the workflow using the Cron node to run at specific intervals.
- Set up email notifications for contract analysis results.

## Conclusion
This workflow provides an automated solution for analyzing contracts through N8N, leveraging integrations with various tools and APIs for efficient processing. Adjust the configurations based on your specific requirements and legal playbook guidelines.
